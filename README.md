# Agency Tracks

Keeping creative professionals and clients on track isn't always easy. Here's a free cloud based tool which allows everyone interested to be on the same page!

Clients and agencies can share a chat window to discuss the project and create tasks with realistic time estimates. Break down the project in to managable steps. See the time involved in each step. Record your progress, and learn from your time estimates with the actual time.

Agency Tracks is a work-in-progress, so pull requests are welcome!
